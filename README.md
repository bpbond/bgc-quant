E3SM intercomparison - quantitative

The E3SM land model has had two approaches to terrestrial biogeochemistry of land modeling: the ELMv1-CTC-CNP (led by ORNL) and ELMv1-ECA-CNP (led by LBNL). In August 2017 DOE and the E3SM leadership tasked this panel with conducting an intercomparison to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each package, and to make recommendations about the future direction of ELM, the E3SM Land Model.

This repository holds the intercomparison code.
