## NP Fertilization

Because the fundamental differences between `ECA` and `CTC` center around their treatment of soil biogeochemistry and the competition between plants and microbes for N and P, the teams agreed to do a set of site-specific runs and compare the models to published data from fertilization experiments. This dataset was assembled by the LBNL team and comprised 100 sites/experiments.

The ORNL team raised both _a priori_ and _a posteriori_ concerns about this observational dataset. Their spot checking found inconsistencies and problems (e.g. PFT assignments), which were confirmed by the panel. As a result we have elected not to calculate site-specific or overall statistics (e.g. R2, RSE, bias) for these simulations but instead evaluate them more qualitatively, looking at whether the model responses broadly accord with fertilization experiment responses. 

## Net primary production

Both models exhibit increased NPP in response to fertilization (absolute values on top, percentage changes on bottom). The `ECA` responses are both larger and more variable. **TODO: separate N and P?**

# Hawaii sites

This well-studied group of sites constitutes about half of the P fertilization dataset.
